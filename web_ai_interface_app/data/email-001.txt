subject: Birthday party cake request

Hello bakery folks!

I would like cake for my kiddo who is turning 6 next week. He loves chocolate and strawberries for filling. Maybe we can have a race car on top? We are having a party for him with 8 kids, total.

Please recommend a cake a give me an estimate. Thanks!
