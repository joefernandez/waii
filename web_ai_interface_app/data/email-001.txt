Subject: Birthday party cake request

Hello bakery folks!

I would like birthday cake for my kiddo who is turning 6 next week. They love chocolate cake and strawberry filling. Maybe we can have a race car on top? We are having a party with 8 kids, total.

Please recommend a cake size and give me an estimate. Thanks!
